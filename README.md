## var1

In PHP, variables are declared by preceding the variable name with a dollar sign($).For example, $variable.PHP is a loosely typed language, which means that you don't have to declare the data type of a variable when you create it.

## var2
In PHP, variable names must start with a dollar sign($), followed by the name of the variable.The variable name is case -sensitive.Variable names follow certain rules: they must begin with a letter or the underscore character; they can't begin with a number; they can contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores.

## var3
PHP is indeed case -sensitive for variable names.This means that $var and $Var would be considered two separate variables.On the other hand, PHP function names are not case -sensitive.This is one of the many aspects that can make PHP tricky for beginners.Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.basics.php

## var4
In PHP, variable names cannot start with a number.They must begin with a letter or an underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores.While the rules for variable names in PHP are somewhat flexible, they do have these constraints to maintain the clarity and readability of the code.Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.basics.php
