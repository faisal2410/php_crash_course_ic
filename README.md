## What is the scope of a variable that is declared within a PHP function?
###### var7
In PHP, a variable that is declared within a function has a local scope.This means it is only accessible within that function. Once the function finishes execution, the variable is destroyed and cannot be accessed from outside the function. This helps encapsulate variables and prevent naming conflicts.Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
## What keyword is used in PHP to access a global variable inside a function?
###### var8
To access a global variable inside a PHP function, the global keyword is used.By declaring global followed by the variable name within the function, you can access and modify the value of the global variable.This allows you to work with global variables within the function's local scope. Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php#language.variables.scope.global

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
## Which type of variable in PHP is accessible anywhere in the script ?

In PHP, a global variable is accessible anywhere in the script.It can be accessed from within functions, outside functions, and across different files.Global variables have a global scope, meaning they can be accessed and modified from any part of the script.However, it's generally recommended to use global variables sparingly and follow good programming practices to avoid potential issues. Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php#language.variables.scope.global

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
## A variable declared within a function in PHP has a ______ scope.
###### var10
A variable declared within a function in PHP has a local scope.It means that the variable is only accessible within that specific function. It cannot be accessed outside of the function or in other functions.This helps in encapsulation and prevents naming conflicts with other variables in different functions.Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## The ______ keyword is used in PHP to make a local variable accessible globally.
###### var11
The global keyword in PHP is used to make a local variable accessible globally.By using the global keyword followed by the variable name within a function, you can access and modify the value of the variable globally, outside the function's local scope. This allows you to work with local variables in a wider scope. However, it is generally recommended to minimize the use of global variables for better code organization and maintainability. Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php#language.variables.scope.global

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

##  A variable declared outside all functions in PHP is considered to have a ______ scope.
###### var12
A variable declared outside all functions in PHP is considered to have a global scope.It means that the variable is accessible from anywhere in the PHP script, including inside functions.Global variables are defined outside of any function and can be accessed and modified throughout the entire script.However, it's generally recommended to use global variables sparingly and follow good programming practices to avoid potential issues related to variable scoping. Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php#language.variables.scope.global

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## In PHP, variables declared inside a function can be accessed outside of that function.
###### var13
Variables declared inside a function in PHP have a local scope.This means they are only accessible within that specific function. Once the function execution ends, the local variables are destroyed and cannot be accessed from outside the function. In order to access variables across different scopes, you would need to use return statements or pass them as parameters.Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## PHP uses the global keyword to make a local variable have global scope.
###### var14
The statement is false. In PHP, the global keyword is used to access and modify variables with global scope from within a function. It allows you to work with global variables within the local scope of a function. By using the global keyword followed by the variable name, you can indicate that the variable being used is the global variable and not a local one. However, it does not change the scope of the variable to global. Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php#language.variables.scope.global

## In PHP forms, you can make a field required by using the required attribute in the HTML.
    
###### phpformhandling22
 The statement is true.In PHP forms, you can make a field required by using the required attribute in the HTML.The required attribute is an HTML attribute introduced in HTML5 that can be added to form fields.When this attribute is included, the browser ensures that the field must be filled out by the user before the form can be submitted.The required attribute provides a client - side validation mechanism to enforce the field's requirement. While PHP can also perform server-side validation, the required attribute is an additional layer of validation provided by the HTML form itself.

###### phpformhandling24
 The statement is false.If a required field is left empty in a PHP form, the form cannot be submitted without entering a value in the required field.The required attribute in HTML ensures that the browser performs client - side validation and prevents form submission if any required field is left empty.Additionally, server - side validation in PHP can also be implemented to further validate and ensure the presence of required field values before processing the form data.It is crucial to enforce required field validation to ensure data integrity and improve the user experience by guiding them to complete the necessary fields.Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/tutorial.forms.php

## What can happen if a required field is left empty in a PHP form ?
    
// Explanation
 If a required field is left empty in a PHP form, the form submission may not be processed, and an error message can be displayed to the user. This depends on the form handling logic implemented. Commonly, form handling in PHP includes validation steps that check if required fields have been filled in. If a required field is left empty, the form submission can be halted, and an error message can be displayed to inform the user about the missing required field. Handling of the empty required field depends on the specific implementation and can vary based on the development approach and user experience requirements.
