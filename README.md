In order to access variables across different scopes, you would need to use return statements or pass them as parameters.Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

## PHP uses the global keyword to make a local variable have global scope.
###### var14
>> The statement is false. In PHP, the global keyword is used to access and modify variables with global scope from within a function. It allows you to work with global variables within the local scope of a function. By using the global keyword followed by the variable name, you can indicate that the variable being used is the global variable and not a local one. However, it does not change the scope of the variable to global. Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php#language.variables.scope.global

## You have a PHP script and you need to get data sent in the URL's query string. How would you do this using the $_REQUEST superglobal?

###### phpsuperglobals52
>> To retrieve data sent in the URL's query string, you can use the $_GET superglobal. However, if you prefer to use the $_REQUEST superglobal, you can access the data using the same syntax as with $_GET.

 ##  Explain the concept of anonymous functions (closures) in PHP. How are they used and what are their advantages?

###### phpanonymousfunction1
>> Anonymous functions, also known as closures, are a powerful feature in PHP that allows you to define functions without a specific name. They are commonly used as callback functions or to create small, self-contained pieces of code. Anonymous functions can access variables from their surrounding scope, even after they have gone out of scope, which is known as "closing over" variables. Their advantages include code encapsulation, code reuse, and the ability to create flexible and dynamic code structures.

By returning the object itself from each method call, you can chain subsequent method calls directly. This leads to more concise and expressive code, as it reduces the need for temporary variables or multiple lines of code. Method chaining is commonly used in libraries and frameworks to provide a fluent and intuitive interface for interacting with objects.
