// ✅ Pagination

// Pagination in PHP is a technique used to split a large set of data into multiple pages for better presentation and user experience. 
// It helps to break down a large amount of data into smaller, more manageable chunks, making it easier to view and navigate. 

// ✅ Advantages

// Improved User Experience: Pagination allows for a more manageable and organized presentation of data, making it easier for users to find what they're looking for.

// Faster Page Load Times: Loading a large amount of data at once can slow down a website, but pagination allows for smaller, quicker-loading pages.

// Better Data Management: Pagination allows for better organization and management of data, making it easier to search, sort, and filter information.

// Increased Usability: Pagination adds navigation links, making it easier for users to move between pages and access the information they need.

// Reduced Server Load: By breaking down data into smaller chunks, pagination can reduce the amount of data sent to the server, which can help to reduce server load and improve performance.
