// Question 1: What is an interface in the context of PHP OOP ?
    
// Explanation
// In PHP OOP, an interface is indeed a contract or a set of rules that defines a specific behavior or functionality.It provides a way to establish a common structure and ensure that classes that implement the interface adhere to that structure.An interface contains only method signatures without implementation.Classes that implement an interface must provide an implementation for all the methods defined in the interface.Interfaces allow for polymorphism and provide a way to define a common interface that multiple classes can adhere to.For further information, visit: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php

// Question 2: How do you define an interface in PHP ?
    
// Explanation
// In PHP, to define an interface, you use the interface keyword followed by the name of the interface.For example: interface InterfaceName { } An interface can contain method signatures without implementation, and it can also define constants.Interfaces establish a contract that classes must adhere to when implementing the interface.Classes that implement an interface must provide an implementation for all the methods defined in the interface.To learn more about interfaces in PHP, refer to: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php

// Question 3: How does a PHP class implement an interface ?
    
// Explanation
// In PHP, a class implements an interface using the implements keyword followed by the name of the interface or a comma-separated list of interface names. For example: class ClassName implements InterfaceName { } By implementing an interface, a class agrees to fulfill the contract defined by the interface.The class must provide an implementation for all the methods defined in the interface.A class can implement multiple interfaces by listing them after the implements keyword.This allows the class to define behavior and functionality according to multiple contracts.To know more about interface implementation, visit: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php

// Question 4: An interface in PHP OOP is a contract that specifies what methods a class ______.

// Explanation
// An interface in PHP OOP is indeed a contract that specifies what methods a class must implement.It establishes a set of rules that a class must follow when implementing the interface.The interface defines the method signatures that the implementing class must provide an implementation for.By adhering to the interface, the class ensures that it provides the required behavior and functionality.Interfaces allow for polymorphism and provide a way to define a common interface that multiple classes can adhere to.To learn more, visit: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php

// Question 5: In PHP, you can define an interface using the interface keyword like interface InterfaceName { ______ }.

// Explanation
// In PHP, to define an interface, you can indeed use the interface keyword followed by the name of the interface.For example: interface InterfaceName { } An interface contains method signatures without implementation and can also define constants.Interfaces establish a contract that classes must adhere to when implementing the interface.Classes that implement an interface must provide an implementation for all the methods defined in the interface.To learn more about interfaces in PHP, refer to: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php

// Question 6: In PHP OOP, a class implements an interface using the implements keyword like class ClassName implements ______.
    
//     Explanation    
// In PHP OOP, a class implements an interface using the implements keyword followed by the name of the interface or a comma-separated list of interface names. For example: class ClassName implements InterfaceName { } By implementing an interface, a class agrees to fulfill the contract defined by the interface.The class must provide an implementation for all the methods defined in the interface.A class can implement multiple interfaces by listing them after the implements keyword, separated by commas.This allows the class to define behavior and functionality according to multiple contracts.To know more about interface implementation, visit: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php

// Question 7: An interface in PHP OOP is a contract that specifies what methods a class must implement.
    
// Explanation
// An interface in PHP OOP is indeed a contract that specifies what methods a class must implement.It establishes a set of rules or a contract that a class must adhere to when implementing the interface.The interface defines the method signatures that the implementing class must provide an implementation for.By implementing the interface, the class ensures that it fulfills the requirements and guarantees the expected behavior.Interfaces allow for polymorphism and provide a way to define a common interface that multiple classes can adhere to.To learn more, visit: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php

// Question 8: In PHP, an interface is defined using the interface keyword.
    
// Explanation
// In PHP, an interface is indeed defined using the interface keyword.This keyword is placed before the name of the interface and is used to declare the interface.An interface consists of method signatures without implementation and can also define constants.Interfaces establish a contract that classes must adhere to when implementing the interface.Classes that implement an interface must provide an implementation for all the methods defined in the interface.The interface keyword is crucial for properly defining an interface in PHP.For more details, refer to: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php

// Question 9: A PHP class implements an interface using the implements keyword.
    
// Explanation
// A PHP class does indeed implement an interface using the implements keyword.This keyword is placed after the class name and is followed by the name of the interface or a comma-separated list of interface names. By implementing an interface, a class agrees to fulfill the contract defined by the interface.The class must provide an implementation for all the methods defined in the interface.Multiple interfaces can be implemented by listing them after the implements keyword.This allows the class to define behavior and functionality according to multiple contracts.To know more about interface implementation, visit: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php

// Question 10: What are some of the uses of interfaces in PHP OOP ?
    
// Explanation
// Interfaces in PHP OOP have various uses, including defining contracts that specify the methods a class must implement, allowing for polymorphism by providing a common interface for related classes, facilitating loose coupling between classes, enabling multiple inheritance of interfaces, and allowing for dependency injection and mocking in testing.Interfaces establish a set of rules that classes must adhere to, promoting code reusability, modularity, and maintainability.For further information, visit: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.interfaces.php

// Question 11: What are the differences between an interface and a class in PHP ?
    
// Explanation
// Interfaces in PHP indeed define a contract for classes to adhere to, specifying the methods that implementing classes must implement. Interfaces cannot be instantiated directly and only provide method signatures without implementation. On the other hand, classes can be instantiated to create objects and can define both method signatures and their implementations. Classes can be inherited by other classes, while interfaces can be implemented by classes. These distinctions differentiate the role and purpose of interfaces and classes in PHP OOP.
