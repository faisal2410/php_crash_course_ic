// Question 1: What are the FTP functions in PHP used for?
    
// Explanation
// FTP functions in PHP are used for interacting with FTP(File Transfer Protocol) servers and performing file transfers.These functions enable PHP scripts to establish connections with remote FTP servers, upload or download files, retrieve directory listings, create directories, delete files, and perform other FTP - related operations.With FTP functions, you can automate file transfers, synchronize remote files, or integrate FTP functionality into your PHP applications.
    
// Question 2: What function do you use in PHP to establish an FTP connection ?
    
// Explanation
// To establish an FTP connection in PHP, you can use the ftp_connect() function with the FTP server hostname, username, and password as parameters.For example, $connection = ftp_connect($ftpServer, $ftpUsername, $ftpPassword); establishes an FTP connection to the specified server using the provided credentials and returns a connection resource.This resource is then used in subsequent FTP operations such as file transfers or directory listings.The ftp_connect() function is a fundamental function for establishing FTP connections in PHP.
    
// Question 3: How do you handle errors when using FTP functions in PHP ?
    
// Explanation
// When using FTP functions in PHP, you can handle errors by checking the return values of the functions.Many FTP functions return false or other specific values to indicate an error.By checking these return values, you can detect errors and take appropriate actions, such as displaying an error message, logging the error, or executing alternative code paths.Additionally, you can use conditional statements and error handling techniques like try-catch blocks to handle exceptions that may occur during FTP operations.It's important to handle errors effectively to ensure proper file transfers and FTP operations in PHP.

// Question 4: What are some common use cases for FTP functions in PHP ?
    
// Explanation
// FTP functions in PHP have various use cases.Some common ones include uploading files to an FTP server, downloading files from an FTP server, synchronizing local and remote directories, retrieving directory listings, creating or deleting directories on an FTP server, and performing other file transfer operations.FTP functions enable PHP scripts to automate file transfers, backup data to remote servers, retrieve files from external sources, or build applications that interact with FTP servers.They provide flexibility and control over file transfer operations in PHP programming.
    
// Question 5: What are some FTP - related functions available in PHP ?
    
// Explanation
// PHP provides several FTP - related functions for working with FTP servers.Some commonly used FTP functions in PHP include ftp_connect()(to establish an FTP connection), ftp_login()(to log in to an FTP server), and ftp_put()(to upload a file to an FTP server).Other functions like ftp_get()(to download a file), ftp_nlist()(to retrieve a directory listing), ftp_mkdir()(to create a directory), and ftp_delete()(to delete a file) are also available.These functions allow PHP scripts to interact with FTP servers and perform file transfer operations.
    
// Question 6: What are some potential issues you might encounter when using FTP functions in PHP ?
    
// Explanation
// When using FTP functions in PHP, you might encounter potential issues such as connection failures, authentication problems, or file transfer errors.Connection failures can occur due to network issues, server unavailability, or incorrect FTP server settings.Authentication issues may arise if the provided credentials are incorrect or if the FTP server has strict authentication requirements.File transfer errors can happen if the remote file does not exist, the local file is not readable, or if there are restrictions on file permissions.It's important to handle these issues by validating input, checking return values, and implementing error handling mechanisms to ensure successful FTP operations in PHP.

// Question 7: You are writing a PHP script and you need to establish an FTP connection.How would you do this ?
    
// Explanation
// To establish an FTP connection in PHP, you can use the ftp_connect() function. This function takes the FTP server hostname as the parameter and returns a connection resource.For example, $connection = ftp_connect($ftpServer); establishes an FTP connection to the specified server and stores the connection resource in the $connection variable.This resource is then used for subsequent FTP operations such as uploading files or retrieving directory listings.The ftp_connect() function is specifically designed for establishing FTP connections in PHP.
    
// Question 8: You have a PHP script and you are getting an error when trying to upload a file to an FTP server.How would you troubleshoot this issue ?
    
// Explanation
// To troubleshoot an error when uploading a file to an FTP server using PHP, you can check the error message returned by the FTP function. Many FTP functions return false or specific error codes to indicate an error.By checking the return value of the FTP function, you can identify the error and take appropriate actions, such as displaying an error message or logging the error details.Additionally, reviewing the function usage and ensuring the FTP server is properly configured can help troubleshoot the issue.By following these steps, you can identify and resolve the error encountered during file uploads to an FTP server in your PHP script.
    
// Question 9: You need to retrieve the error message after an FTP operation fails in your PHP script.How would you do this ?
    
// Explanation
// If there is an error during an FTP operation in PHP, you can use the ftp_error() function to retrieve the last FTP error message. This function returns a string containing the error message associated with the last FTP operation. For example, $errorMessage = ftp_error($ftpConnection); retrieves the error message from the FTP connection resource and stores it in the $errorMessage variable. This allows you to retrieve and handle the error message after an FTP operation fails in your PHP script.
