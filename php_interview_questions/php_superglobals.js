// Question 1: What is the $_POST superglobal in PHP?

// Explanation
// The $_POST superglobal in PHP is a built-in associative array that allows access to data sent to the server through an HTML form using the POST method. The values in $_POST are retrieved based on the "name" attribute of form inputs. This superglobal is commonly used to handle sensitive data, such as passwords or personal information, as it keeps the data hidden from the URL and is not stored in the browser's history.
