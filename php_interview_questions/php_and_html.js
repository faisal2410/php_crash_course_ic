// Question 1: How can PHP and HTML interact ?
    
// Explanation
// PHP and HTML can interact by embedding PHP code within HTML using the <?php ?> tags. This allows you to dynamically generate HTML content by executing PHP code. PHP can be used to generate dynamic content, retrieve data from databases, handle form submissions, and more. By combining PHP and HTML, you can create dynamic and interactive web pages.
