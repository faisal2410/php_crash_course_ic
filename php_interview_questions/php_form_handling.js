// Question 1:  How can we access the data sent through the URL with the GET method?

// Explanation
// To access the data sent through the URL with the GET method in PHP, you can use the $_GET superglobal array. This array contains key-value pairs of the query parameters passed in the URL. For example, if your URL is example.com?page=about&section=services, you can access the values of page and section using $_GET['page'] and $_GET['section'], respectively. The $_GET array allows you to retrieve and use the data sent through the URL via the GET method in your PHP script. It's important to note that you should sanitize and validate any user-provided input to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity of your application.

// Question 2:  How can we access the data sent through the URL with the POST method?

// Explanation
// To access the data sent through the URL with the POST method in PHP, you can use the $_POST superglobal array. This array contains key-value pairs of the form data submitted using the POST method. For example, if you have an input field with the name username in your form, you can access its value using $_POST['username']. The $_POST array allows you to retrieve and use the data sent through the POST method in your PHP script. It's important to note that you should sanitize and validate any user-provided input to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure the integrity of your application.
