// Question 1:  What should we do to be able to export data into an Excel file?

// Explanation
// To export data into an Excel file using PHP, you can use a PHP library such as PhpSpreadsheet or PHPExcel. These libraries provide APIs for creating and manipulating Excel files in various formats. They allow you to generate Excel files, set cell values, apply formatting, and perform other Excel-related operations. By using these libraries, you can export data from PHP into Excel files with ease. It's important to note that you need to include the library files and follow the library's documentation to properly use their features. For example, you can use PhpSpreadsheet to create and save Excel files by following its documentation and using appropriate functions and methods.
