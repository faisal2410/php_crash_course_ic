// Question 7: PHP supports eight primitive data types.
    
// Explanation
// This statement is true.PHP supports eight primitive data types: integer, float, string, boolean, null, array, object, and resource.These data types are the building blocks for storing and manipulating data in PHP.Each data type has its own characteristics and uses.Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.intro.php

// Question 8: In PHP, a string can contain letters, numbers, and special characters.
    
// Explanation
// This statement is true.In PHP, a string can contain letters, numbers, special characters, and even control characters.It is a versatile data type used for storing and manipulating text or sequences of characters.Strings can be enclosed in single quotes(''), double quotes("") or heredoc / nowdoc syntax.Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php

// Question 9: In PHP, an array can only hold values of the same data type.
    
// Explanation
// This statement is false.In PHP, an array can hold values of different data types.PHP allows you to store elements of different data types, such as integers, floats, strings, or even other arrays, within the same array variable.This flexibility makes arrays powerful and versatile for managing collections of related data.Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php

// Question 10: Which of the following are valid data types in PHP ?
    
// Explanation
// All of the given options are valid data types in PHP.PHP supports various data types, including integer(int), boolean, float, string, array, object, resource, and null.These data types are used for storing and manipulating different kinds of data in PHP scripts.Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.php

// Question 11: Which of the following PHP data types can hold multiple values?
// Explanation
// The array data type in PHP can hold multiple values.Arrays are used to store collections of values, and they can hold elements of different data types.An array allows you to organize and access multiple values using keys or indexes.Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.array.php
    
// Question 12: Which of the following are true about PHP data types ?
    
// Explanation
// All of the given options are true about PHP data types.PHP is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't need to declare a variable's type explicitly.PHP automatically converts data between compatible types, which provides flexibility in variable assignments and calculations.Additionally, PHP allows you to explicitly specify data types for function parameters and return values using type declarations.Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.php
    
// Question 13: You need to store a user's age in your PHP script. What data type would you use and why?

// Explanation
// To store a user's age in a PHP script, you would use the int data type. The int data type is used for storing whole numbers, such as the age of a person. Since the age is typically represented as a whole number without a decimal, int is the most appropriate data type for this scenario. Using int ensures that the value is stored efficiently and allows for mathematical operations if needed. Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.integer.php

// Question 14: You have a variable in your PHP script that needs to hold a simple true or false value.What data type would you use ?
    
// Explanation
// To hold a simple true or false value in PHP, you would use the boolean data type. The boolean data type is specifically designed to store either true or false values. It is commonly used in conditions, logical operations, or to indicate the success or failure of an operation. By using the boolean data type, you can ensure that the variable only holds the expected true or false values, providing clarity and correctness to your code.
