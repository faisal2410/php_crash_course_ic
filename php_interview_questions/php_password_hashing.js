// Question 14: How can you implement secure password hashing in PHP ? Discuss the password_hash() and password_verify() functions.
    
// Explanation
// Secure password hashing in PHP is crucial for protecting user passwords. The password_hash() function is used to securely hash passwords using industry-standard algorithms such as bcrypt. It automatically handles the generation of a unique salt and multiple iterations, making the hashing process more secure. The password_verify() function is used to verify a user's entered password against the stored hash. By using these functions, you can significantly improve the security of user passwords and protect against common attacks such as rainbow table attacks. It is strongly recommended to use these functions instead of manual hashing techniques. For more information, you can refer to the PHP documentation: http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php, http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-verify.php
