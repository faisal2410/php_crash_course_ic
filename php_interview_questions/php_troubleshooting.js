// Question 1: You have installed PHP on your local machine, but your PHP script isn't running. What could be potential reasons for this?

// Explanation
// There could be several reasons why a PHP script isn't running. PHP might not be properly installed, or the web server might not be correctly configured to handle PHP files. There could also be syntax errors within the PHP script that prevent it from executing correctly. In some cases, file permissions or the PHP configuration file (php.ini) settings can also cause issues. Learn more: https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php

// Question 2: You've written a PHP script, but it's not executing correctly. You suspect there's a syntax error. How would you go about debugging this?

// Explanation
// PHP offers several ways to debug scripts. Running the script with a PHP interpreter can reveal error messages that can help identify the problem. PHP also maintains an error log file that you can check for errors. Furthermore, using a PHP linter or a similar code checking tool can help identify syntax errors in your script.
