//Question 1 : How can PHP and JavaScript interact?

// Explanation
// PHP and JavaScript can interact in several ways. One common way is by embedding PHP code within JavaScript code using <?php ?> tags. This allows you to dynamically generate JavaScript code on the server-side using PHP. Another way is by making AJAX requests from JavaScript to PHP, sending data asynchronously and receiving responses. This enables communication between the client-side JavaScript and the server-side PHP. Additionally, cookies can be used to share data between PHP and JavaScript by setting and retrieving cookie values. This allows for data exchange between the two languages.
