// Question 1:  Explain the concept of anonymous functions (closures) in PHP. How are they used and what are their advantages?

// Explanation
// Anonymous functions, also known as closures, are a powerful feature in PHP that allows you to define functions without a specific name. They are commonly used as callback functions or to create small, self-contained pieces of code. Anonymous functions can access variables from their surrounding scope, even after they have gone out of scope, which is known as "closing over" variables. Their advantages include code encapsulation, code reuse, and the ability to create flexible and dynamic code structures.
