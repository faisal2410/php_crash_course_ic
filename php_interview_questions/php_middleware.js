// Explain the concept of middleware in PHP frameworks. How does it facilitate request/response handling and provide modular code organization?

// Explanation
// Middleware in PHP frameworks is a concept that enables modular and flexible request/response handling. It acts as a bridge between the web server and the application, allowing you to intercept and process requests and responses. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as authentication, input validation, logging, or modifying the request/response objects. By using middleware, you can achieve code reusability, separation of concerns, and easy modification of the request/response pipeline. Middleware provides a modular approach to handling HTTP requests and responses, making it easier to add or remove functionality as needed. For more information, you can refer to the documentation of popular PHP frameworks like Laravel or Symfony: https://laravel.com/docs/middleware, https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_kernel.html#kernel-boot
